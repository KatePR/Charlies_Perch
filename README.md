# CS 691 Restaurant Website Project

This is a website developed using Visual Studio 2015. The different languages and markup languages used in this project include C#, HTML, CSS, and JQuery.
There is also a SQL database that stores user login information. For this project, I, along with other students, had to create our own 
webstie for a figurative restaurant.
